CODING FOR PITOT FLANGES FAMILY 02 REV -=06/05/2015=-


Coding of standard flanges is based on features. When a new feature is added a new code is added to this file.The code is additive, if a feature is not present a number of 0 equal to standard code feature length should be added.
Features and codes
-Family name
Length: two digits
02 Removable flange
-Fixation holes number

-Type of pressure ports
Length: eigh digits
First and second digit, static port type from the below table
Third and fourth digit, parameter that describe the port features, read here below
Fifth and sixth digit total pressure port type from the below table
Seventh and eight, parameter that describe the port features, read here below

Pressure ports type table
01 Barbed
 Specification digits are the rounded diameter of coupling in mm. If the measure is 3.6 it is possible to write 36
02 Push-in, quick fitting
Specification digits are the rounded diameter of coupling in mm. If the measure is 3.6 it is possible to write 36

-Position of pressure ports
Length: two digits
Looking from the flange side to the pitot tip.
L =left side
R=Right side
T=Top side
B=Bottom side
F=Fore side
A=Aft side
First digit, static port position
Second digit, total pressure port position
-Position of fixation tabs
Length: two digits
Looking from the flange side to the pitot tip.

First digit table
L =left side
R=Right side
T=Top side
B=Bottom side
F=Fore side
A=Aft side
Second digit table
A=Non Symmetrical fixing
S=Symmetrical fixing


The basic removable flange for 8mm Pitot tube is then coded
"020408C02442502500205AARS" This code will represent the 3D model file name.
